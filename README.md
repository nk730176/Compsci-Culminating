# Compsci-Culminating
Program Name: CrossyRoad

Project Overview:

I, Nikolay, have decided to improve my GUI project which was a modified version of Crossy Road. 
In Crossy Road the player(Chicken) tries to cross the road and avoid the cars. The game runs until the chicken gets hit or isnâ€™t on the screen.
I will try to make the cars move in one direction like in the actual game with different car models. Also, I want to make it run infinitely until the user messes up.
The main theme will be fun and colorful, but I plan to add an option to change skins. With the ability to change skins the environment will change as well according to the skin.
I plan to have a file that stores the high score of the user to see if they can beat it and the last skin used. Moreover, I plan to add rivers and allow the chicken to move in any direction.
The goal of the project is to make the game as close as possible to the actual game. I chose Crossy Road because I like the game (900 Highscore) and I think it utilizes the topics learned in the course very well.
It has collisions, methods, file reading, and animation which I can work on and improve in this project.
